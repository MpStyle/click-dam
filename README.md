# Click DAM

My first approach to Electron world.

## To Use

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
#Build
npm run build
# Run the app
npm start
```

Note: If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.

## Re-compile automatically

To recompile automatically and to allow using [electron-reload](https://github.com/yan-foto/electron-reload), run this in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run watch
```
